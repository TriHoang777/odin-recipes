    <p class="page4p">Spaghetti is a popular Italian pasta, often served with a tomato sauce sometimes called spaghetti sauce. The Italian word spago means string, and spaghetti is the plural of spago â€” a description of what spaghetti looks like. Spaghetti straps are very thin shoulder straps found on dresses and summery tops. In the late 1960s, "spaghetti westerns" were movies about the Wild West, filmed in Italy and directed by Italians.</p>

        <li class="page4ul">1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion</li>
        <li class="page4ul">3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li class="page4ul">2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li class="page4ul">1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li class="page4ul">Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li class="page4ul">1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li>
        <li class="page4ul">1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li class="page4ul">Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li class="page4ul">Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
        <li class="page4ul">12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>
        <li class="page4ul">1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="page4h2">Optional Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="page4ul">2 to 3 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
        <li class="page4ul">3 to 4 anchovy fillets, minced with some of their oil or use anchovy paste</li>
        <li class="page4ul">Pinch sugar</li>
        <li class="page4ul">1 leftover rind from a wedge of parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="page4h3">Make Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="page4ol">Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
        <li class="page4ol">Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li class="page4ol">Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li class="page4ol">Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="page4h3">Cook Spaghetti</h3>
    <ol class="page4ol">
      About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="page4h3">To Finish</h3>
    <ol class="page4ol">
      Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
    </ol>
